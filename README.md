# multi-sig_smart_contract

A multi-signature contract is a smart contract designed so that multiple signatures from different addresses are needed for a transaction to be executed. This project is a part of Alchemy University's Ethereum developer bootcamp curriculum.

## Implementation Overview

In the above case, the smart contract requires 2-of-3 keys signatures in order to approve and send a transaction to the Ethereum network.

With this setup, it doesnâ€™t matter whether one individual loses their key, as there will be other individuals that can approve transactions, kick out the compromised key and re-add the compromised user under a new address.

Splitting responsibility of ownership of an address and its funds between multiple people means the multi-sig wallet is secure against a single key being the single point of failure. Even if there is a malicious party in the multi-sig contract, they would need to corrupt a majority of the holders to compromise the wallet entirely.

The transaction IDs are zero-based. In the first `addTransaction`, the transaction with Id 0 is added and the `transactionCount` becomes 1.
In the next `addTransaction`, the transaction with Id 1 is added and the `transactionCount` becomes 2 and so on.

## Use cases

A multi-signature contract acts as a "wallet" as it can hold and transfer funds. It is called "multi-sig" because it typically needs greater than one signatures to approve any wallet activity such as transferring funds out. Since multi-sigs are powered by multiple keys, they avoid a single point of failure, which makes it significantly harder for funds to be compromised. This design provides a higher degree of security against lost or compromised keys.

Here are a few use cases that can be powered by a multi-signature smart contract wallet:

- Families: Inheritance, Wills, Approved Expenditure of House Expenses
- Businesses/Startups: Business Expenses, Treasury Management, Embezzlement Protection
- Teams/Organizations: Team Jerseys, Travel Expenses
